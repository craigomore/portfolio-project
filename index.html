   <p>Born <i><u>8th September 2005</u></i>,I turn 20 a few days after making this portfolio.
    I currently live in Syokimau.People think I look older than I actaully am.</p>   
    
    <h2><u>About</u></h2>
    <p>I grew up in <i>Eastlando</i>. Been to alot of schools throughout my childhood.
        The ones that had the most impact on my life are "Buruburu 1 primary school" and
        "Merishaw School" Since I did my final exams in both schools. I got 356 marks on
        my K.C.P.E and an A- on my K.C.S.E .I later joined "Moringa school" to do a course 
                in Software Development.I would not say it is out of passion but curiosity and the 
        desire to just know more but lucky for me I hear people say money coming MY way 
        is a by-product of the course.
             </p> 

    <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
    <p>Not to brag but I am good at Math.It has been a while since I sat down and did 
    any form of math so I'm a little rusty.I might also be generally stong for my body
    weight(I weight lift,is that a skill?YES)I played Rugby but took a break.I plan on
    getting back to it next year to probably start training as a coach professionally 
    or just get back to playing the game.I also write music and make beats.lol.

    <h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
    <p>I have so far been able to start 2 projects.both incomplete but very promising.
        I used html,css,java,and a small percentage of python on the projects.
        <ul><li>Project 1</li>
     
            <li>project 2</li></ul></p>
